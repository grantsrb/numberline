class Register:
    """
    The register tracks the coordinates of all objects within the game.
    The possible objects are:
      targs - the target items for the game
      items - the moveable items for the game
      piles - the location for players to make and delete items
      players - the agents within the game
      dividers - a dividing line across the middle of the map to
        distinguish playable area from target area
      buttons - a button to press once the player thinks the task is
        finished
    
    The register has two data structures to track the items in the game.
    It has a set called obj_register that holds all of the GameObjects
    that are not dividers. It also has a dict called coord_register
    that maps coordinates to sets of items. Only coordintates with
    items are included in the coord_register.

    The register also performs basic game logic. It handles moving the
    player, prevents illegal moves, and handles item placement and
    item creation (when player grabs from piles).

    If the player was carrying an object and stepped onto another
    object, the game is handled as follows. While the player
    continues to grab, all objects and the player remain overlayn.
    If the player releases the grab button while an object is on
    top of another object, one of 2 things can happen. If the 
    underlying object is a pile, the item is returned to the pile.
    If the underlying object is an item, the previously carried
    item is placed in the nearest empty location from its current
    coord.

    The order of the search is the pixels connected to the argued
    coordinate starting in the upper left connected pixel moving
    across the top to the right, then lower left pixel moving
    across the bottom to the right, then leftmost pixels in
    between the top and bottom moving from top to bottom, then the
    rightmost pixels in between the top and bottom. If none of
    these spaces are free, the search repeats one more layer
    outward.
